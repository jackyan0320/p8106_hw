Create a training set containing a random sample of 800 observations, and a test set containing the remaining observations. Use set.seed() for reproducible results.

``` r
data(OJ)

oj <-
  as.tibble(OJ) %>% 
  mutate(Store7 = recode(Store7, '1' = 'Yes', '0' = 'No'),
         Store7 = as.numeric(Store7))

#split the data into training and test sets
set.seed(1)
rowTrain <- createDataPartition(y = oj$Purchase,
                                p = 799/1070,
                                list = FALSE)
train_df = oj[rowTrain,]
test_df = oj[-rowTrain,]
dim(train_df)
```

    ## [1] 800  18

### (a)

Fit a support vector classifier (linear kernel) to the training data with `Purchase` as the response and the other variables as predictors. What are the training and test error rates?

### (b)

Fit a support vector machine with a radial kernel to the training data. What are the training and test error rates?

### (c)

Which approach seems to give a better result on this data?
